The files in this repository are questions from a linear algorithms and data structures assignment that was completed in semester 1 
of 2nd year.

The 2 java files are the files that I had to modify. The methods already existed but without the bodies. My job was to program
each method so that when it was called in main, it functioned correctly and produced the correct output regardless of the input.

Contained within both of the zipped folders are files that were supplied by the lecturer. The Main consistes of the methods all being called.
Everything including nodes and lists were supplied.
